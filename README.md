# Car Prices Prediction #
This notebook was created for a university Machine Learning project. The goal of the project is to train and evaluate one or more regression models to predict the sales price of used cars. The project is based on a dataset containing about 40k examples of used cars sold in the UK.

Pay attention to the dataset paths: if you want to try this notebook on your own data, you need to change the paths in the functions defined at the beginning.
